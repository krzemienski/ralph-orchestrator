Add structured logging to the file `src/ralph_orchestrator/learning/ace_adapter.py`.

Find all methods that don't have logging and add appropriate log statements:

1. Add `logger.debug()` at the start of each method showing method name and key parameters
2. Add `logger.info()` for important state changes (skillbook loaded, skills learned, etc.)
3. Add `logger.warning()` for recoverable error conditions
4. Add `logger.error()` for failures with stack traces

Use this pattern:
```python
logger.debug(f"method_name called | param1={value1} | param2={value2}")
logger.info(f"State changed | old={old} | new={new}")
logger.warning(f"Recoverable issue | reason={reason}")
logger.error(f"Operation failed | error={str(e)}", exc_info=True)
```

Requirements:
- Use the existing logger if one is defined, or create one with `logging.getLogger(__name__)`
- Keep log messages concise but informative
- Include relevant context (iteration number, skill counts, etc.) in log messages
- Do NOT add excessive logging that would spam the logs
