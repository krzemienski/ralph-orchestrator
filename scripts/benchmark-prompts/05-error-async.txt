Create a test file `tests/test_async_patterns.py` that demonstrates correct async/await patterns.

The file should include:

1. An async test function that properly awaits coroutines
2. A test that uses `pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator
3. A test that properly handles async context managers
4. A test that properly handles async iterators

Common mistakes to avoid (and demonstrate the correct way):
- Don't forget `async` keyword on test functions that use await
- Don't forget to await coroutines
- Don't use sync calls inside async functions where async versions exist
- Properly use `async with` for async context managers

Requirements:
- Use pytest-asyncio for async test support
- Include comments explaining why each pattern is correct
- Each test should actually test something meaningful (not just demonstrate syntax)
- Use asyncio.sleep(0.01) to simulate async operations
