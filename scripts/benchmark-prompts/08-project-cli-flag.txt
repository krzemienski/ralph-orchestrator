Add a new CLI flag `--dry-run` to the ralph CLI that shows what would be executed without actually running.

Modify `src/ralph_orchestrator/main.py` to:

1. Add the `--dry-run` argument to the argument parser
2. Pass the flag through to RalphConfig
3. Handle the flag in the orchestration logic to show plan without executing

When `--dry-run` is active:
- Print the prompt that would be sent
- Print the adapter that would be used
- Print the configuration (max iterations, model, etc.)
- Print "Dry run mode - no execution" and exit cleanly

Requirements:
- Follow the existing CLI flag patterns in main.py
- Add appropriate help text for the flag
- The flag should work with all adapters
- Include a test case suggestion in comments
