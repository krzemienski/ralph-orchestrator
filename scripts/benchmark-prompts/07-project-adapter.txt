Create a new adapter called `RooAdapter` in `src/ralph_orchestrator/adapters/roo.py` following the existing adapter patterns.

Study the existing adapters (particularly `claude.py` and `base.py`) and create a new adapter that:

1. Inherits from `ToolAdapter` base class
2. Implements the required `execute(prompt: str, **kwargs) -> ToolResponse` method
3. Implements `aexecute` for async support
4. Has proper `__init__` with configuration
5. Uses the same logging patterns as other adapters
6. Includes proper type hints

The RooAdapter should:
- Be a placeholder that returns a mock response (we don't have the actual Roo CLI)
- Follow the exact same patterns as ClaudeAdapter
- Include docstrings matching the style of other adapters
- Be properly registered (add to adapters/__init__.py exports)

Requirements:
- Match the coding style of existing adapters exactly
- Include all standard adapter methods
- Add appropriate error handling
- Include the ABOUTME comment at the top of the file
