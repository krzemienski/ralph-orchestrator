There's a file with broken imports at `tests/test_broken_imports.py`. Create this file with intentionally broken imports, then fix them.

First, create the broken file with these issues:
1. Import from wrong module path (e.g., `from ralph_orchestrator.adaptor import ClaudeAdapter` - misspelled)
2. Import a non-existent class (e.g., `from ralph_orchestrator.orchestrator import RalphRunner` - doesn't exist)
3. Circular import pattern (import something that would import this file)
4. Missing __init__.py in a new test subdirectory

Then fix all the import errors so the file can be imported successfully.

The fixed file should:
- Import ClaudeAdapter correctly from ralph_orchestrator.adapters.claude
- Import RalphOrchestrator from ralph_orchestrator.orchestrator
- Avoid circular imports
- Have proper directory structure

Verify the fix works by adding a simple test function that uses the imports.
