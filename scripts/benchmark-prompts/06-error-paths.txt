Create a utility script `scripts/path_utils.py` that handles file paths correctly across Windows and Unix.

The script should include:

1. `normalize_path(path: str) -> Path` - Convert any path string to a proper Path object
2. `ensure_directory(path: str) -> Path` - Create directory if it doesn't exist, return Path
3. `safe_join(*parts: str) -> Path` - Safely join path parts (like os.path.join but using pathlib)
4. `get_relative_to_project(path: str) -> Path` - Get path relative to project root

Common mistakes to fix in the implementation:
- Don't use string concatenation for paths (use Path / operator)
- Don't hardcode path separators ('/' or '\')
- Handle both absolute and relative paths
- Handle paths with spaces correctly
- Use Path.resolve() to handle '..' and symlinks

Requirements:
- Use pathlib.Path exclusively (no os.path)
- Include type hints
- Include docstrings
- Add a test section in `if __name__ == "__main__":` that tests each function
- Handle edge cases (empty string, None, etc.)
