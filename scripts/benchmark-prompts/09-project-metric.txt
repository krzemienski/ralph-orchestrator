Add a new metric `rollback_count` to track how many times checkpoints were rolled back during orchestration.

Modify the metrics system in `src/ralph_orchestrator/metrics.py` to:

1. Add `rollback_count: int = 0` to the appropriate dataclass
2. Add a method to increment the rollback count
3. Include rollback_count in the metrics summary output

Then modify `src/ralph_orchestrator/orchestrator.py` to:

1. Increment the rollback count when a checkpoint rollback occurs
2. Include rollback_count in the final summary

Requirements:
- Follow the existing patterns in metrics.py
- Ensure the metric is properly initialized
- Include the metric in JSON output if metrics are exported
- Add appropriate logging when rollbacks occur
