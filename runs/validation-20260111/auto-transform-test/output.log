/Users/nick/Library/Python/3.12/lib/python/site-packages/langchain/agents/__init__.py:39: LangChainDeprecationWarning: As of langchain-core 0.3.0, LangChain uses pydantic v2 internally. The langchain_core.pydantic_v1 module was a compatibility shim for pydantic v1, and should no longer be used. Please update the code to import from Pydantic directly.

For example, replace imports like: `from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel`
with: `from pydantic import BaseModel`
or the v1 compatibility namespace if you are working in a code base that has not been fully upgraded to pydantic 2 yet. 	from pydantic.v1 import BaseModel

This is a simple, clear task - create a Python script that prints "Hello World".
Let me first check the scratchpad to see what was done in the previous 
iteration.
