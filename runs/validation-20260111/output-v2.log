/Users/nick/Library/Python/3.12/lib/python/site-packages/langchain/agents/__init__.py:39: LangChainDeprecationWarning: As of langchain-core 0.3.0, LangChain uses pydantic v2 internally. The langchain_core.pydantic_v1 module was a compatibility shim for pydantic v1, and should no longer be used. Please update the code to import from Pydantic directly.

For example, replace imports like: `from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel`
with: `from pydantic import BaseModel`
or the v1 compatibility namespace if you are working in a code base that has not been fully upgraded to pydantic 2 yet. 	from pydantic.v1 import BaseModel

This is a clear, specific task. Let me check the scratchpad to see what was 
accomplished in iteration 1, and read the task file.I see there's a mismatch. 
The scratchpad shows previous work on a "Phase 6 Validation" task with a 
different message, but the actual task file shows the requirements are still 
unchecked and asks for "Hello from validation test!". Let me check if 
greeting.py exists in the validation directory:The greeting.py doesn't exist in 
the validation directory. The scratchpad seems to be from a different task. Let 
me create the greeting.py file with the correct message:Now let me verify the 
script works correctly:The script works correctly. Now let me update the task 
file to mark the requirements complete and add the completion marker, then 
commit the changes:Now let me update the scratchpad and commit the changes:The 
task is complete. I have:

1. ✅ Created greeting.py with a main() function in the validation directory
2. ✅ The script prints the exact message: "Hello from validation test!"
3. ✅ Verified the script runs correctly
4. ✅ Marked requirements complete in the task file
5. ✅ Committed the changes
