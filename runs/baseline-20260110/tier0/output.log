  Create hello.py file            ✅ Already existed, updated  
  Print "Hello, World!" message   ✅ Fixed punctuation         
  Make it executable              ✅ chmod +x applied          
                                                               

hello.py now:                                                                   

 • Prints Hello, World! with proper comma and exclamation mark                  
 • Is executable (can run with ./hello.py)                                      
 • Follows Python best practices (shebang, main function, docstrings)

by reading the scratchpad and confirming the implementation exists.
