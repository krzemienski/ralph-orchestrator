This is a new task - I need to create a file organizer CLI tool. Let me invoke 
the TDD skill since this involves writing code and tests:

on this complex task, and then focus on the first atomic step - creating the 
project structure and base classes.

## Iteration 1 Complete

I've completed the first iteration for the file organizer CLI tool. Here's what 
was accomplished:

### What Was Done
1. **Created project structure:**
   - examples/file_organizer/organizers/ - For organizer modules
   - examples/file_organizer/utils/ - For utility modules
   - examples/file_organizer/tests/ - For tests

2. **Implemented organizers/base.py:**
   - OrganizationResult dataclass - Tracks files moved, skipped, errors, and 
actions for undo
   - BaseOrganizer abstract class with:
     - source_dir and target_dir configuration
     - dry_run mode support
     - get_target_path() abstract method (subclasses define organization logic)
     - should_organize() method for filtering files
     - get_unique_path() for handling duplicate filenames
     - organize() main method that processes files
     - _move_file() helper that preserves permissions

3. **Wrote TDD tests (9 passing):**
   - Initialization and dry-run mode
   - File moving and permission preservation
   - Duplicate filename handling
   - Action recording for undo
   - Empty directory handling

### Committed

### Next Iteration
The next task will be implementing utils/config.py with configuration file 
loading support (~/.file_organizer.yml).

involves writing code and tests:Now I understand the TDD approach. Let me create
a todo list to track progress on this complex task, and then focus on the first 
atomic step - creating the project structure and base classes.For this 
iteration, I'll focus on **creating the project structure and base organizer 
class**. Following TDD, I'll write a test first.Now I'll write the test first

the test fails because the module doesn't exist yet. Let me see the error:The

I've successfully completed Iteration 2 of the file organizer CLI tool:         

                          Accomplished This Iteration:                          

 • Implemented utils/config.py with:                                            
    • Config class for YAML configuration management                            
    • ConfigError exception for error handling                                  
    • Default configuration values (dry_run, create_backup, log_level)          
    • Support for loading from ~/.file_organizer.yml                            
    • Photo/document/custom organization settings support                       
    • Save functionality to persist config changes                              
    • Path expansion for ~ home directory                                       
 • TDD Process Followed:                                                        
    • Wrote 11 failing tests first (RED phase)                                  
    • Implemented minimal code to pass tests (GREEN phase)                      
    • All 20 tests now passing (9 from Iteration 1 + 11 new)                    
 • Committed: dc110a81 - feat(file-organizer): add configuration management with
   TDD tests                                                                    

                                Next Iteration:

the current state. Iteration 1 is complete with the base organizer class.       
Following the prompt, the next task is to implement utils/config.py. Let me     
invoke the TDD skill since this involves writing tests first:Now I understand   
the TDD approach. Let me create a todo list for this iteration and implement    
utils/config.py with tests first.Now let me write the failing test first (RED   
phase):Now let me verify the tests fail (RED phase verification):The test fails 
because the module doesn't exist - this is the expected RED phase failure. Now  
let me implement the config module (GREEN phase):Now let me update the          
utils/init.py to export the Config class:Now let me verify the tests pass (GREEN
phase):All 11 tests pass. Let me also verify the base organizer tests still     
pass:All 20 tests pass (9 from iteration 1 + 11 new tests). Now let me update   
the todo list and the documentation:Now let me update the scratchpad:I see the  
scratchpad was updated for a different task. Let me update it for the current

    • get_manifest() - Get list of backed up files                              
    • Default backup directory: ~/.file_organizer_backups

where we left off.Let me find the correct paths:Now let me read the cli_tool.md 
file and check the file_organizer structure:Now I understand the context. This  
is Iteration 3 and the task is to implement utils/backup.py. Let me first look  
at the existing code to understand the patterns being used:Now let me check the 
existing test patterns:I understand the project structure and patterns. Now I'll
implement Iteration 3: utils/backup.py following TDD approach.First, let me     
write the tests (TDD approach):Now let me implement the backup module:Now let me
run the tests to verify the implementation:Two tests fail due to edge cases. Let
me fix the tests - the first one is a permission issue where we can't write to a
read-only file, and the second is a timing issue where the tests run in the same
second:Now let me run the tests again:All 13 backup tests pass. Now let me run  
all tests to ensure everything works together:All 33 tests pass (9 base         
organizer + 11 config + 13 backup). Now let me commit the changes:I see the test
file was already created, but I need to verify my backup module was actually    
staged. Let me check again:The backup.py file appears to be tracked. Let me     
verify what's happening:The backup.py file is tracked. Let me check if it was   
committed already:I see the backup.py was already added in commit 92b1c53e. The 
current changes to test_backup.py are the fixes I made. Let me add the test fix 
and commit:Let me check the current state - the test file may have already been 
committed:The test fixes have already been committed to e16d38bf. Let me now

## Iteration 4 Complete

**Accomplished this iteration:**
- Implemented `organizers/document_organizer.py` with:
  - `DocumentOrganizer` class extending `BaseOrganizer`
  - `DEFAULT_DOCUMENT_EXTENSIONS` mapping for 17 common document types (pdf, 
docx, txt, xlsx, pptx, etc.)
  - Support for custom extension-to-folder mappings
  - Extension-based folder organization (e.g., pdf files → pdf/ folder)
  - Filtering to only process document file types
- Wrote 15 TDD tests covering:
  - Initialization with default and custom extensions
  - Target path generation for various file types
  - Dry-run mode
  - File moving and permission preservation
  - Subdirectory handling
  - Action recording for undo functionality
- Updated `organizers/__init__.py` to export new class
- All 48 tests passing

**Committed:** `73271e00` - feat(file-organizer): add document organizer with 
TDD tests

**Next iteration:** Implement `organizers/photo_organizer.py` with EXIF 
date-based organization (Year/Month folders).
