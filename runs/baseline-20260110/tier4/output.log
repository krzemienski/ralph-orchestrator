The Flask REST API has been successfully implemented. Let me provide a summary:

## Summary - Flask REST API Implementation Complete

I've successfully built a complete Flask REST API for user management with the 
following:

### Files Created (examples/flask-api/)
- **app.py** - Main application (320 lines) with:
  - Flask 2.0+ application setup
  - User model with SQLAlchemy ORM (id, name, email, created_at, updated_at)
  - All 5 CRUD endpoints (GET /users, GET /users/<id>, POST /users, PUT 
/users/<id>, DELETE /users/<id>)
  - Root endpoint with API documentation
  - Input validation helper with comprehensive error messages
  - Error handlers for 400, 404, 409, 500

- **test_app.py** - 26 unit tests covering:
  - Index endpoint
  - GET endpoints (empty list, with data, multiple users, not found)
  - POST endpoint (success, validation errors, duplicate email)
  - PUT endpoint (partial updates, not found, conflicts)
  - DELETE endpoint (success, not found)
  - Edge cases (email normalization, whitespace trimming)

- **requirements.txt** - Dependencies
- **README.md** - Full API documentation with curl examples

### Test Results

## Summary

✅ **Task Complete: Flask REST API for User Management**

### What Was Built
- **Flask application** with SQLite database and SQLAlchemy ORM
- **User model** with id, name, email, created_at, updated_at
- **5 CRUD endpoints**: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE for users
- **Input validation**: name required, valid email format, max lengths, unique 
email constraint
- **Error handling**: 400 (validation), 404 (not found), 409 (conflict), 500 
(server error)
- **26 unit tests**: All passing
- **Documentation**: Full README with curl examples

I'll check the scratchpad and verify the current state of the implementation to 
understand what's been completed.Let me get the correct path and check the 
current state:Now I understand the situation. The Flask REST API task in 
examples/web-api.md shows all requirements are marked as complete with all 26 
tests passing. Let me verify the implementation is actually complete by running 
the tests:All 26 tests pass. The Flask REST API task is complete. Let me verify 
the documentation exists and update the scratchpad to reflect the current task 
status:The Flask REST API task is fully complete with:
- ✅ All requirements checked off
- ✅ All 26 tests passing
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Working implementation

Now I need to update the scratchpad to reflect the web-api task completion and 
ensure everything is properly committed:The Flask API is already committed (no 
changes shown for it). Let me check the git log for the flask-api commit:The 
Flask API is already committed. Now I'll update the scratchpad to reflect the 
completed web-api task and add a completion note to the task file:I see the 
scratchpad has been updated for a different task (web_scraper). The web-api.md 
task I'm working on is already fully complete based on the task file showing all
checkboxes marked. Let me update the scratchpad to reflect the web-api task

- **app.py** - Main application with User model, CRUD endpoints, validation, 
error handling
- **test_app.py** - Comprehensive test suite (26 tests)
- **requirements.txt** - Dependencies (Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, pytest)
- **README.md** - Full API documentation with curl examples

### Test Results
All **26 tests pass**:
- Index endpoint, GET/POST/PUT/DELETE users
- Validation errors (missing fields, invalid email, duplicate email, name too 
long)
- Error handling (404 not found, 409 conflict)
- Edge cases (email normalization, whitespace trimming)

### Commit
`c32e417e` - chore: Mark Flask REST API task as complete

The orchestrator can proceed to the next task as this one requires no further 
iterations.
