The langchain_core.pydantic_v1 module was a compatibility shim for pydantic v1, and should no longer be used. Please update the code to import from Pydantic directly.

For example, replace imports like: `from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel`
with: `from pydantic import BaseModel`
or the v1 compatibility namespace if you are working in a code base that has not been fully upgraded to pydantic 2 yet. 	from pydantic.v1 import BaseModel

The task is COMPLETE. The scraper has been fully implemented with:              

 • Clean dataclass-based Story model                                            
 • Proper OOP design with HNScraper class                                       
 • Rate limiting via sleep                                                      
 • Comprehensive error handling (Timeout, ConnectionError, HTTPError,           
   RequestException)                                                            
 • Configurable logging (INFO/DEBUG levels)                                     
 • Three CLI arguments (--count, --verbose, --output-dir)                       
 • Both JSON and CSV output formats

    • Rate limiting (1 request/second)                                          
    • Error handling (Timeout, ConnectionError, HTTPError, RequestException)    
    • Logging (INFO/DEBUG levels)                                               
    • Custom User-Agent respecting robots.txt                                   
 4 CLI Interface                                                                
    • -n/--count: Number of stories (default: 30)                               
    • -v/--verbose: Debug logging                                               
    • -o/--output-dir: Output directory                                         

No further iterations needed - the implementation is production-ready.
