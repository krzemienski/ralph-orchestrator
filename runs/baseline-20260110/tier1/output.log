Let me start by creating the test file first, following TDD discipline:Now let  
me write the first failing test - starting with the mean function:Now let me    
verify RED - watch the test fail:The test fails with an import error - exactly  
what we expect since statistics_helper.py doesn't exist yet. This is the        
expected RED phase - the test fails because the feature is missing.             

Now let me implement the minimal code to make this test pass (GREEN phase):Now  
let me verify GREEN - the mean tests should pass:Excellent! Mean tests pass. Now
I'll add the median tests (RED phase for median):Verify RED for median          
tests:Tests fail with None == 3 - expected failure because median is not        
implemented. Now implement median (GREEN):Verify GREEN for median tests:Now add 
mode tests (RED phase for mode):Verify RED for mode tests:Tests fail with       
expected None == X. Now implement mode (GREEN):Verify GREEN for mode tests:Now  
add edge case tests (RED phase for edge cases):Verify RED for edge case         
tests:The empty list test fails with a ZeroDivisionError instead of ValueError. 
Now implement edge case handling (GREEN):Verify GREEN - all tests pass:All 12   
tests pass. Now let me update the scratchpad and commit the changes:Now let me  
update the task file with completion status and commit the changes:Now let me   
commit the changes:I have successfully completed the task. Here's a summary:    


                   Task Complete: Statistics Helper Function                    

                                 Created Files                                  

examples/statistics_helper.py                                                   

 • calculate_statistics(numbers) function that returns mean, median, and mode   
 • Handles edge cases: empty list raises ValueError, single element supported   
 • Mode calculation handles ties by returning the smallest value                
 • Full docstrings with examples                                                

examples/test_statistics_helper.py                                              

 • 12 unit tests following TDD approach:                                        
    • TestMean (2 tests): simple list, floats                                   
    • TestMedian (3 tests): odd length, even length, unsorted input             
    • TestMode (3 tests): clear mode, ties, all unique                          
    • TestEdgeCases (4 tests): empty list, single element, two elements,        
      negative numbers                                                          

                              TDD Process Followed                              

 1 RED: Wrote failing tests first (for mean, median, mode, edge cases)          
 2 Verified RED: Confirmed each test failed for the expected reason             
 3 GREEN: Wrote minimal code to pass each test                                  
 4 Verified GREEN: Confirmed all tests pass

 • statistics_helper.py - Full implementation with type hints and docstrings    
 • test_statistics_helper.py - Comprehensive test suite covering all            
   requirements                                                                 

No further iterations are needed for this task. The orchestrator can signal     
completion.

The task file already shows **Status: COMPLETE**. I have verified that:

✅ **statistics_helper.py** exists with:
- `calculate_statistics(numbers)` function
- Full type hints and docstrings with examples
- Edge case handling (empty list raises ValueError, single element, ties return 
smallest)
- Mean, median, and mode calculations

✅ **test_statistics_helper.py** exists with:
- 12 comprehensive unit tests
- All tests pass

✅ **All requirements met:**
1. ✓ Takes a list of numbers as input
2. ✓ Returns the mean, median, and mode  
3. ✓ Handles edge cases (empty list, single element)
4. ✓ Includes docstring with examples

**This task is complete. No further iterations are needed.** The orchestrator 
can signal task completion.
