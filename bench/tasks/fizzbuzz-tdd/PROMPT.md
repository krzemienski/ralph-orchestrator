# FizzBuzz TDD Task

Implement FizzBuzz using test-driven development. A test file `test_fizzbuzz.py` has been provided with failing tests.

## Requirements

- Create `fizzbuzz.py` with a `fizzbuzz(n: int) -> str` function
- For multiples of 3, return "Fizz"
- For multiples of 5, return "Buzz"
- For multiples of both 3 and 5, return "FizzBuzz"
- For all other numbers, return the number as a string

## Workflow

1. Run the tests: `pytest test_fizzbuzz.py -v`
2. Observe which tests fail
3. Implement the function to make tests pass
4. Repeat until all tests pass

## Completion

When all tests pass, output: TESTS_PASSING
